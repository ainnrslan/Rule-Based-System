# Rule-Based-System
This project is a Streamlit web application that evaluates scholarship applicants using a rule-based expert system. Users can input their CGPA, family income, co-curricular score, and disciplinary record. The system then applies predefined rules to determine the applicant’s scholarship eligibility and priority level.
